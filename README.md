BinderAV
========
This project is intended to create an executable that gives the illusion of a working anti-virus. This code will serve as a basis for penetration testers to bind with backdoors, keyloggers etc. without arousing suspicion in their victims.  This code is only meant as an example.  Direct copy-pasta creates a signature.  

If you use this code, delete all comments from the batch script.
